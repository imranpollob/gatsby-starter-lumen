\- Very simple to get started. Other competitors are far more complex. React is just JavaScript, there is a very small API to learn, just a few functions and how to use them. A JavaScript developer can become a productive React developer in a few hours.

\- Working with the DOM API is hard. React basically gives developers the ability to work with a virtual browser that is more friendly than the real browser. Reactâ€™s virtual browser acts like an agent between the developer and the real browser.

\- React enables developers to declaratively describe their User Interfaces and model the state of those interfaces. In declarative programming, you just describe the program/UI/component not the procedure to implement/run it and someone else like React will implements it.

\- Backed by Facebook and actively maintained by hundreds of contributors.
