Reversing is a common task in programming. Different language handle this task differently. I will try to figure it out in one place.

PHP:

```
$a = "Hello World!!!";echo strrev($a);
```

Python:

```
a= "Hello World!!!"print(a[::-1])
```

JavaScript:

```
var word = "Hello World!!!";console.log(word.split("").reverse().join(""));
```
