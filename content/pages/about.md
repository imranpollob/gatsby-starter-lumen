### Hi 👋, its **Imran**. I am fascinated to have you here.

I love to develop things. I am helping people and companies to achieve their goal by designing and developing the **finest product**.

I love to to play with **PHP** and **JavaScript**. I started coding at my college and from then I am helping school students to learn programming. Sharing my knowledge with simple words always motivates me.

Professionally, I started my career at 2016. I feel blessed because I paired up with some of the **best developers** of my country. I am learning a lot of things from them.

I am proud to run projects like **GoGreen**, where we are trying to make the planet green again and **BdMakers**, where we are connecting small entrepreneurs to the customers. I have some cool prototypes under development.
